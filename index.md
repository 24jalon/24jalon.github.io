Hello, I am a computer science major at California State Fullerton and I plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L labs

Lab 2, part 1

I really enjoyed this lab since it was the first time I ever programmed something. Previously I had tried to code but had no success. Creating something as simple as this really allowed me to understand the basics on how to print words to the console. Along with this, I learned how to use the compiler, linter, and run tests.

Lab 7, part 1

Lab 7 required us to print if we could park or not based on the street name, hour, and day. This was one of my favorite labs since it required me to use loops as well as different operators. Thanks to this I was able to understand how they work, and finished the lab with no errors. This was also a lab where I feel like me and my partner's collaboration was the best.

Lab 12, part 2

This lab was my favorite since it was a culmination of everything we had learned in 4 months. We worked with loops, vectors, variables, and classes in order to create a moving “gif” image. This really helped me understand how C++ can be used to create moving objects. This helped me understand the possibilities that can be accomplished with object oriented programming.
